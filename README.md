# Monte Carlo Simulations in R

The code in the following R script file conducts Monte Carlo
simulations and loops over different numbers of observations and clusters. From this we are 
able to explore the reliability of the estimates of variance for our OLS estimates. Ratios of the 
clustered standard errors are reliable around 1. By using different numbers of observations and 
clusters we are able to find the minimum number of clusters for reliable inference.
